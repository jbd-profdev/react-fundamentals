                <p>Functionl Components are the primary tool used in React to build a small, modular piece of your application.</p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Can access state</dt>
                    <dd>By passing props, Functional Components are capable of both rendering state variables for display, as well 
                        as updating the value of state variable(s). We'll take a deeper dive into state and props later on - so 
                        don't fret if that doesn't make sense right now.</dd>
                    <dt>No <i>this</i> keyword</dt>
                    <dd>Class Components (or stateful components) in React will always require the use of <i>this</i> keyword 
                        when initializing an object using the constructor method. Functional Components (or display components), 
                        however, are instanceless - meaning they have no access to the <i>this</i> keyword.</dd>
                    <dt><i>return()</i></dt>
                    <dd>Functional Components (as well as Class Components) must return a single element - but the single element 
                        from the function may have children elements nested inside of it.</dd>
