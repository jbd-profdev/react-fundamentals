                    <h1>Class Components</h1>
                    <p>Class components are the bread and butter of most React applications. While more verbose than functional components, they offer more 
                        control in the from of state management and life-cycle methods.</p>
                    <dl>
                        <dt>Must extend React.Component</dt>
                        <dd>The <i>extends React.Component</i> statement creates an inheritance to <i>React.Component</i>, and gives your component access to 
                            <i>React.Component</i>(s) functions and methods. Without extending from <i>React.Component</i>, your class will just be a plain ol' 
                            JavaScript class with no access to any React specific functionality.</dd>
                        <dt>Requires a <i>render()</i> method</dt>
                        <dd>Unlike functional components that just require a return, class components utilize both the <i>render()</i> method, as well as the 
                            <i>return</i> keyword. A class component MUST utilize the <i>render()</i> method, or it will throw an error.</dd>
                        <dt>State management</dt>
                        <dd>The state is an instance of a React class component that can be defined as an object of a set of observable properties that control 
                            the behavior of the component. In other words, the State of a component is an object that holds some information that may change 
                            over the lifetime of the component.</dd>
                        <dt>Life-cycle methods</dt>
                        <dd>You can think of the React life-cycle as a series of events that happen starting with the birth of a React Component, all the way to 
                            its death. Every component in React goes through a life-cycle of events, which we can access to perfrom certain tasks during a 
                            particular point in the components life-cycle. <strong>E.g.:</strong> when the component is created, I want to fire off a fetch request.</dd>
